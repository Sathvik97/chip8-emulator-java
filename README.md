A CHIP 8 emulator written in Java

An Emulator is a hardware or a software system which enables one computer to mimic the behaviour of another system to run certain software and programs.

# The purpose of Emulator:
---->They are used to replicate the functionality of older systems to run old video games or old outdated operating systems on modern hardware

# Type of Emulators
1.CPU emulators:The simplest version of the CPU emulator is an interpreter, a program that tracks the execution path for emulated programs.
Game console emulators: These emulators allow users to use games designed specifically for the consoles on various platforms, such as computers, smartphones and gaming consoles, replicating the hardware and software environment of a console.

2.Operating System Emulators: The operation system emulators enable users to use a number of operational systems simultaneously on the same hardware, simulating the behavior of all IT systems.

3.Network Emulators: Network emulators allow users to test and verify the performance, reliability and scalability of network applications and systems by simulating real network conditions and environments.

4.Application-Specific Emulators: Application Specific emulators are aimed at replicating the individual software components or interfaces and providing compatibility with applications developed for a variety of platforms as well as environments.

# WHY EMULATORS??
---> Safety & Malware Research
If a cybersecurity expert wants to see what a virus does, they won't run it on their actual laptop,like the Sandbox which is a isolated testing environment that basically allows developers to safely execute program or software without harming the main system,they run it inside an emulator because the emulator is just a program, if the virus destroys the emulated computer the actual physical laptop stays safe. You can simply reset the emulator and start over.

--->The most common use of an emulator is to run software on a machine it was never designed for.
Example: Most modern computers use x86 processors, but mobile apps are built for ARM processors.
Why it matters: Without emulators, a developer would need to own 50 different physical phones to test an app. An emulator lets them simulate a Samsung Galaxy or an iPhone directly on their MacBook.
